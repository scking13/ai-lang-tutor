# Simple Python Application

This is a simple Python application that prints a greeting message.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `app/`: This directory contains the main application code.
  - `__init__.py`: Makes the `app` directory a Python package.
  - `main.py`: The main script for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python dependencies for the project (currently empty).
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
2.  **Run the application using the following command:**

    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

    This will execute the `greet()` function in `app/main.py`, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
